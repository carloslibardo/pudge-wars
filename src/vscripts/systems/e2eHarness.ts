/**
 * Convar-gated headless end-to-end harness.
 *
 * This is what lets a machine with no human in front of it prove the game
 * actually works. Launch Dota in tools mode with `+pudge_wars_e2e 1`, and the
 * harness seats bots, drives them at each other until someone wins, and prints
 * `[E2E]` markers the VM rig greps out of `console.log` to issue a verdict.
 * See `testrig/` and playbook chapter 06.
 *
 * Convars:
 *   pudge_wars_e2e         1 engages the harness (default 0, tools mode only)
 *   pudge_wars_e2e_kills   win-threshold override, to keep runs bounded
 *
 * Every code path here is inert in a real match. That matters: the harness must
 * never be able to affect a game a human is playing.
 *
 * TWO WAYS TO SEAT BOTS — pick by mode, and never use `dota_bot_populate`,
 * which hard-crashes the tools client in a laneless FFA map (landmine L4):
 *
 *   - `dota_create_fake_clients` (used here) is CHEAT-GATED. It works in tools
 *     mode, where sv_cheats is on, and is SILENTLY IGNORED on a retail client —
 *     you get a log line, zero joins, and no error.
 *   - `GameRules.AddBotPlayerWithEntityScript` is the cheat-free API for
 *     filling a real lobby. It creates the hero itself, so it is seated at the
 *     horn rather than during setup.
