 * Custom net table contracts — the server writes them, the Panorama UI reads

 *
 * A table also has to be listed by NAME in `game/scripts/custom_net_tables.txt`
 * or the engine silently refuses the write. Keep the two in sync.
 *
 * Prefer a net table over a fire-once event for anything that is STATE: a
 * client whose UI loads late still reads the current value, whereas an event
 * fired before the panel existed is gone forever.
